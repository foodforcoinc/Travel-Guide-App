2. Personal Considerations
   - Dietary restrictions/preferences
   - Accessibility needs

##### Optional Profile Elements
Purpose:
These optional elements enhance the app's ability to connect users with guides who share similar backgrounds, experiences, or identities. By sharing this information, users receive more personally relevant recommendations, helping them find spaces where they'll feel welcomed, comfortable, and connected to community. This information is always private, optional, and used solely to improve guide matching and recommendation relevance.

Elements:
- Personal identifiers (private)
  * Gender Identity
  * Cultural Background/Ethnicity
  * Languages
  * LGBTQ+ Identity
  * Accessibility Needs
  * Age Range
  * Family Travel (children/pets)

[Note: All optional elements are private, used only for matching and recommendation purposes. Fun extras like Astrological Sign, Myers-Briggs Type, etc. provide additional matching points for interested users but are not core to the matching algorithm.]

##### Profile Development
- Visual progress bar showing completion percentage
- Dynamic match quality indicator
- Multiple quiz types
- City-specific preference questions
- Location-based responses

[Note: Basic preferences (dining style, activity level, budget, atmosphere) are derived from questionnaire responses and Right Now flow choices rather than direct input]

   - Personal recommendations
   - Insider tips

2. Personal Preferences

3. Matching Logic

   - Secondary: Pattern matching from choices
     * Recurring atmospheres in selections
     * Consistent features across venues
     * Price point patterns
   - Tertiary: Implicit style preferences
     * Not "wine expert" but "often recommends wine bars"
